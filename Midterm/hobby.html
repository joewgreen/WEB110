      <h2>Weightlifting</h2>
      <p>
        Weightlifting has been a hobby of mine for the past half decade or so, and it's probably my favorite and most important hobby in my life.
        I've had self-esteem issues since I was young, and ever since I stepped into the gym, I was hooked. The gym became a place for me to release my frustrations into the weight I was lifting—and it had the added benefit of getting me fit in the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        It became like a fun, new game for me: going for personal bests and always trying to progress and be the best I could be. It's helped me build confidence, discipline, and focus—not just physically, but mentally too.

        <li>Squat – great for overall strength and legs</li>
        <li>Bench Press – a classic test of upper body power</li>
