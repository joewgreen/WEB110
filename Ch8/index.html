      <h2>What is the Fourth of July?</h2>
      <p>
        The Fourth of July, or Independence Day, is a U.S. holiday commemorating the adoption of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776.
        The holiday is celebrated with patriotic displays, fireworks, parades, concerts, and family gatherings. Red, white, and blue decorations
        fill towns and cities, symbolizing the American flag and the spirit of freedom. It's a day when people come together to honor the country's
        history, celebrate liberty, and reflect on the values that shaped the nation.

      <h2>How Flexbox Works</h2>
      <p>
        Flexbox is a CSS layout model that arranges items in rows or columns. Items can grow, shrink, and align efficiently with less code.
        Flexbox makes it easy to design flexible and responsive layout structures. It allows items within a container to be arranged in rows or columns
        and to adjust their size and position automatically. With Flexbox, you can easily align, space, and distribute elements, even when their size is
        unknown or dynamic.
